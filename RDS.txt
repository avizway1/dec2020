MultiAZ Deployment :
--> Disaster Recovery Solution for RDS instances.
--> THis feature cost us double the price. 
--> When we enable this feature, Another copy of our RDS instance runs in another AZ.
--> MultiAZ not used for Scaling. 

ReadReplica :
--> Designed for Scaling purpose.
--> For readReplcia we will get another Endpoint, Using this endpoint we can offload the read operations from the primary db.
--> We can create readreplica in ANother Region, if required.
--> If something happens to Primary, ReadReplcia operations won't effect.

--> In future, if we want to break the replication, We can Promote the "Read Replica.'
--> Once replication breaks, we cannot reestablish it.
--> However, if required we can create a Another readreplica.
--> We will use ReadReplicas to take Snapshots of Prod Databases. (No I?O freazes for Write operations)

RDS : We manage backups of RDS using Snapshots.
--> Snapshots are PITR (Point in Time Recovery).
--> In Place Restortion is not possible.
--> We can restore from the Snapshots, But we will get a New RDS Endpoint.
--> We can copy to another region and we can launch an RDS instance.
--> We can Share this sna[pshots with another AWS acocunt user. We can even make it public.

--> Automated Snapshots / System Snapshots : Creates automatically, if we enable "Automated Backups" while launching RDS instances.
--> We cannot delete these system Snapshots.
--> If we delete RDS instance, these deletes autimatically.
--> Max Backup retention period is 35 Days. 

--> Manual Snapshots : We need to create manually, We delete manually.
