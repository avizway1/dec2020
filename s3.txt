S3: SImple Storage Service : 

object based storage : Store the flat files (.pdf.docx.exe.msi).. We cannot install OS/Run any applications.. : S3

Block Based Storage : Designed to run OS.. EBS / Instance Store..

Storage Over Network : SAN/NAS.. We 'll have storage within the network.. We can mount it servers.. : EFS / FSx


--> We store all the data in Buckets.
--> Bucket = Directory / Folder with Unique name space. 
--> Bucket name must be unique across the globe.
--> Bucket naming limits (COmply DNS Naming standards)
	--> Min 3 char.. Max 63 Char
	--> Name should not start with . 
	--> Name should not end with .
	--> No Adjesent ..
	--> SHould not Resemble IP address format
	--> No Capital letters.. 
	--> Should not start with xn--

--> IAM and S3 is a Global Platform, Doesn't required to choose the region.
--> But whenever we are cretaing a bucket, We need to choose the region.
--> We store all the objects in Bucket.


Block public access (bucket settings) --> Must be turned off to make any object public.

If we don;t have . in bucketn name..
Syntax : https://bucketname.s3.regioncode.amazonaws.com/objectname

If we have . in bucketn name..
Syntax : https://s3.regioncose.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname



S3 Storage Classes

S3 Standard : availability : 99.99% , Durability : 99.999999999 %.. Frequently accessed data..   >= 3 AZs.. 

Standard-IA : availability : 99.9% , Durability : 99.999999999 %.. Designed to store Infrequently accessed data.. Data will be available immediatley..  >= 3 AZs.. 

Onezone-IA : availability : 99.5% , Durability : 99.999999999 %.. Designed to store Infrequently accessed data, non-critical data.. Data will be available immediatley..  1 AZs.. 

Glacier : TO archieve data for longer durations.. We cannot view the data immedialtly.. We need to retrive the data..  Long-term data archiving with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours.. >3 AZs

Glacier Deep Archieve : TO archieve data for longer durations.. We cannot view the data immedialtly.. We need to retrive the data.. Long-term data archiving with retrieval times within 12 hours.. >3 AZs

Intelligent Tier : Long-lived data with changing or unknown access patterns.. If we are not sure to choose the storage class.. 

RRS (Reduced renduncy storage) : Durability is less.. 99.99%.. Not recpmmended.. Easily reprodusable data.. Non-Mission critical data..

Versioning : 
--> It keeps all the versioned objects.
--> Upload time is matter here.

Versioning : HIDE
--> If we accidentally delete the object, We will get "DELETE Marker". We can delete the DM to get the object back.

Versioning : SHOW
--> If we delete any Object, It deletes perminently. We cannot get the object back.
--> If we want to delete any SPecific version, Set Version:SHOW, then delete.



Lifecycle Management Rule : 


Free Tier : 5 gb Standard Storage Class.. 
2000 PUT (Upload)
20,000 GET (Download)

CRR / SRR : Cross Region Replication / Same Region Replication : 

--> Before enableing CRR/SRR, WHatever the data we have, that doesn'r replicate automatically. All future / subsequent uploads will replicate.

--> aws s3 sync sourcebucket destinationbucket


MFA Delete on S3 Bucket : TO add additional layer to delete object.


Tags : Customer provided metadata. 
Project Name : Project X


Intelligent-Tiering Archive configurations : It moves the data to Archive / Deep Archive automatically if data is not accessed in last 90 days / 180 Days.

Server Access Logging : Won't use this..!!! : Enable logging on one s3 bucket. 


Event notifications : 
--> SQS
--> Lambda
--> SNS (SImple Notification Service)


SNS : Create a Topic : Add subscribers --> Configure this SNS on S3 bucket.
** SNS topic and S3 Bucket should be in same region.


Task : COnfigure Same Region Replication on S3.

Task 2 : COnfigure Notifications if an object is deleted.

Task 3 : Configure a billing alarm on your aws account with the created SNS topic.

Encryption : 

In-Transit Encryption : SSL / TLS 


Server Side Encryption (SSE) / At-Rest : AWS Responsibility..

--> SSE-S3 : S3 Generatres and manages the keys to encrypt and decrypt the data. Who ever have S3 access they can decrypt the data.

--> SSE-KMS : Key Management Service : 
	aws/s3 : KMS generates and manages the Key and Key Material. WHoever have access 		on s3, they can encrypt/decrypt the data. * FREE TIER (20k req/Month)
KMS-CMK : Customer managed keys : Using KMS customer need to generate the 			encryption keys.. KMS manages the key and key material.. **NO FREE TIER
Whoever want to decrypt the data, he needs permission on encry key.

Symmetric : A single encryption key that is used for both encrypt and decrypt operations.
Asymmetric : A public and private key pair that can be used for encrypt/decrypt or sign/verify operations

--> SSE - C (Client Provided) : We need to upload the key material to kms and KMS manages the Key material and encrypts the data.


Key Creation: Choose Symmetric / Asymmetric : Symmetric
Key ALias and Descryption
Key administrators : Who can manage the Key.
key usage permissions : Who can use this key.  : 



Client SIde Encryption :  
--> Customer Not ready to share/upload his key material to AWS.
--> Whoever don;t want to Send any unencrypted data to s3.
--> AWS not responsible for tis CSE.



--> We can create only 100 buckets. (Soft Limit)

Transfer acceleration : **NO FREE TIER : 

Object Lock : 
--> For existing bucket we cannot enable Object lock. If required We need to contact aws.
--> Versioning must be enabled to use obkect lock.

Governance : Users with specific IAM permissions can overwrite or delete protected object versions during the retention period.

Compliance : No users can overwrite or delete protected object versions during the retention period.

Requester pays : Instead of bucket owner, whoever access the data, he needs to pay / we'll get charged for the data transfer and requests.


Static website hosting : We can host a static website using s3 bucket.
--> DOmain Name = Bucket Name

Http STatus Codes :
2XX : OK / SUccess
3XX : Redirection 
4XX : CLient Side Error
5XX : Server Side Error

Metrics : 
--> Cloudwatch : Monitoring service on AWS. 
--> CW gives metrics/graphs on resources.
